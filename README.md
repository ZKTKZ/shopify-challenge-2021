# README

## Introduction
This image repository was developed for the Shopify Summer 2021 Challenge. This self-hosted solution allows  users to upload images, search their images based on ML-detected features, and view all available images. 


## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation
0. Clone this repo by typing in `git clone https://github.com/ZKTKZ/shopify-challenge-2021.git`
1. Create an account with Okta, and replace 'XXXX' in config/application.yml
2. Create an account with Cloudinary, and replace 'XXXX' in config/cloudinary.yml
3. To start the server, run `bin/rails s` from the root

### Usage
1. Log in with your Okta account
2. Upload a few photos -- they can be absolute file paths, or online-hosted
3. Now, go to `/photos/search` to search for your photos. You can also view all photos by navigating to the base URL `/`.

## Overview 
The app follows the MVC paradigm. I used this challenge as an opportunity to learn Ruby on Rails.

For CSS styling of our views, we use PicoCSS, while JSON views are handled by JBuilder to separate View and Controller. 

User authentication is managed by Okta SSO, and Cloudinary is used as a CDN. ActiveRecord Sessions enable a user's login state to be tracked across different pages in the application. See the Gemfile for a full list of dependencies.
### Tests
Unit tests for models are in the models folder under `/tests`

### üß± Models

To interact with the database, run `bin/rails c` from root, and then use Active Query. iThe application has a User Model, which is handled by Devise and Omniauth-Okta.

### üó∫Ô∏è Routes
`/config/routes.rb`
The following routes are relevant for the end user:

/photos/create

/photos/search

/photos/show

N.B. Cloudinary may take upto 5 minutes to show newly uploaded assets.

### üéÆ Controllers
`/app/controllers`

### Potential Improvements
A few ideas for improving the application:
- [] Use Ruby namespaces for api versioning
- Move from sqlite to Postgres database, as...
- Use partials for duplicate view logic per DRY coding standards
- Cloud-hosted deployment. Cloudinary and Okta libraries for security are both expensive services ($100/month for Cloudinary alone), so an already-deployed version was not launched
